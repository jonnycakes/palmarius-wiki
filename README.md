## Entity Relationship Diagram
![ERD](./assets/erd-final-revised.png)

**Notes on ERD**
- I'm planning my database schema ahead to include authors, categories, and tags in advance.
  - Tags are a reach goal, and the tags are their join table are set up that I can easily drop the concept if I don't like it.
- I've specifically designed each table to hold just one concept. That means I'm not jamming a category into the article table, because categories are their own thing.
- Using LucidChart again, and the special characters on the lines define the relationship between tables (not just signify that there is one!)
